•	We observe here that the parameters of each population (mean, variance, lambda) is close to the theoretical value. As the number of samples increases from 100 to 10000, the approximation is improved and the deviation is reduced; for both methods of generation-matlab routines as well as rejection method. This observation follows the Law of Large Numbers. In each case, we get a smoother curve for the largest sample as compared to the smallest sample value.
•	The variations we observed in the above cases is because of the number of samples taken into consideration. We can see that as n tends to infinitely many samples, the mean and variance approaches values that are close to the theoretical value.
